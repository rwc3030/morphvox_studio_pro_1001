- **Feature 1: Login Form**
  - **User Story 1: As a user, I want to log in to my account so that I can access my profile.**

      2. The login button should be disabled until both fields are filled.
      3. An error message should be displayed for incorrect credentials.
      4. The login form should handle cases where the username or password is empty and provide appropriate feedback.
      5. There should be a mechanism to limit the number of login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
      6. The error message for incorrect credentials should not reveal whether the username or password was incorrect to enhance security.
