## Remaining Features and Tasks
1. Implement a mechanism to limit the number of login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
2. Ensure the error message for incorrect credentials does not reveal whether the username or password was incorrect to enhance security.
3. Consider implementing a loading state when the login button is clicked to improve user experience.

## Code Duplication and Cleanup Actions
