# Architect Notes

## Remaining Features and Tasks
1. Implement a mechanism to limit the number of login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
2. Ensure the error message for incorrect credentials does not reveal whether the username or password was incorrect to enhance security.
3. Consider implementing a loading state when the login button is clicked to improve user experience.

## Code Duplication and Cleanup Actions
- Identified duplicated code in the login form validation logic across multiple files.
- Refactored the validation logic into a single utility function located in `source/utils/validation.js`.
- Updated all relevant files to use the new utility function, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy.
- Documented the changes made to improve maintainability and clarity in the codebase.

## Bugs and Functional Issues
- **Issue:** The login form does not provide feedback when the username or password fields are empty upon submission.
- **Fix:** Implemented validation to check for empty fields and display appropriate error messages.
- **Issue:** The loading state is not visually indicated when the login button is clicked.
- **Fix:** Added a loading spinner to the login button during the authentication process.
- **Issue:** The maximum length for username and password fields is not enforced in the UI.
- **Fix:** Added input attributes to limit the length of username and password fields to 20 characters.

## File and Directory Structure Adjustments
- The project files match the directory requirements specified in 'README.md'. No structural issues were found.
