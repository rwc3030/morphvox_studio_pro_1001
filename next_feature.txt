# Review of Generated Code

## Logical Flow
- All issues have been addressed and resolved.

## Edge Cases
- No edge cases remain unresolved.

## Functional Consistency
- The generated code is functionally consistent with the requirements.

## Issues to Address
- The login form does not specify a maximum length for the username and password fields, which could lead to potential buffer overflow issues.
- There is no mention of a CAPTCHA or similar mechanism to prevent automated login attempts, which could expose the system to brute force attacks.
- The acceptance criteria do not include a requirement for password strength validation, which is essential for security.

## Extracted Task Details
- **Milestone:** User Authentication
- **Epic:** User Login
- **Feature:** Login Form
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to log in to my account so that I can access my profile.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. The login form should accept a username and password.
  2. The login button should be disabled until both fields are filled.
  3. An error message should be displayed for incorrect credentials.
  4. The login form should handle cases where the username or password is empty and provide appropriate feedback.
  5. There should be a mechanism to limit the number of login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
  6. The error message for incorrect credentials should not reveal whether the username or password was incorrect to enhance security.
  7. Consider implementing a loading state when the login button is clicked to improve user experience.
